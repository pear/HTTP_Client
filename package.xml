  <name>HTTP_Client</name>
  <summary>Easy way to perform multiple HTTP requests and process their results</summary>
  <description>
The HTTP_Client class wraps around HTTP_Request and provides a higher level interface 
for performing multiple HTTP requests.

Features:
* Manages cookies and referrers between requests
* Handles HTTP redirection
* Has methods to set default headers and request parameters
* Implements the Subject-Observer design pattern: the base class sends 
events to listeners that do the response processing.

  <release>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
    <date>2006-06-03</date>
    <license>PHP License</license>
    <state>stable</state>
    <notes>
Fixes:
* Fixed PHP warning if cookie path was empty (bug #1987)
* Fixed fatal PHP error on empty URL, PEAR_Error is returned now (bug #2933)
* Do not try to follow redirects to non-HTTP URLs (bug #5759)

Feature additions:
* It is possible to define a constant HTTP_CLIENT_QUIRK_MODE in your script,
  if it is present then HTTP_Client will follow common browser behaviour
  rather than RFC 2616. Currently this means: always do a GET request 
  on a 301 redirect (request #1854).
* HTTP_Client now analyzes the response body for &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot;&gt;
  tags and follows the redirects defined in them (request #5734)
* Added possibility to send extra headers with requests (request #7552)
* It is now much easier to store permanent cookies received by HTTP_Client:
  added magic __sleep() and __wakeup() methods to CookieManager class to aid
  in its (un)serialization, added getCookieManager() method to HTTP_Client, 
  added possibility to pass CookieManager object to HTTP_Client's 
  constructor (request #7578).
